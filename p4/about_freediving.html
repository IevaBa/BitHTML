        <p>
          Freediving, is a form of underwater diving that relies on
          breath-holding until resurfacing rather than the use of breathing
          apparatus such as scuba gear. Besides the limits of breath-hold,
          immersion in water and exposure to high ambient pressure also have
          physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in
          freediving. Examples of freediving activities are traditional fishing
          techniques, competitive and non-competitive freediving, competitive
          and non-competitive spearfishing and freediving photography,
          synchronised swimming, underwater football, underwater rugby,
          underwater hockey, underwater target shooting and snorkeling. There
          are also a range of "competitive apnea" disciplines; in which
          competitors attempt to attain great depths, times, or distances on a
          single breath. Historically, the term free diving was also used to
          refer to scuba diving, due to the freedom of movement compared with
          surface supplied diving

        <h2>Freediving disciplines in depth:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong> Constant Weight (CWT)</strong> is the most widely practiced
          depth discipline of freediving. The diver descends and ascends
          vertically along a dive rope using the propulsion of a monofin or
          bi-fins and/or arm strokes. The dive rope cannot be used for pulling
          and the diver is only allowed to hold on to it once, while turning at
          the bottom and preparing for the ascent. As the name of this
          discipline suggests, the diver is not allowed to change the amount of
          ballast weight used during the course of the dive.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Constant Weight Without Fins (CNF) </strong>requires the
          divers to use only muscle strength to propel themselves downwards and
          back up again. The freediver normally descends on breaststroke pretty
          similar to what swimmers do. Just like in CWT, the diver is not
          allowed to pull on the rope or change the weight used. CNF is
          considered the most difficult of the three competitive depth
          disciplines.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Free Immersion (FIM)</strong> is similar to Constant Weight
          Without Fins as the amount of weight during the dive has to stay the
          same, and the diver cannot use any propulsion equipment. However, in
          this case, the diver can pull on the guide rope to descend and ascend.
          FIM is considered one of the more relaxing disciplines, since the
          technique is fairly easy to learn, the diver can use both “head down”
          and “head up” position, and go down as slowly as he/she wants. Free
          Immersion is also a great discipline to practice equalization.
